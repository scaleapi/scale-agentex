# Introduction to Agentex

AI agent capabilities can be understood in five levels, from simple chatbots to fully autonomous, self-driving agentic systems:

![Levels of AI Agents](images/levels_of_ai.png)

Today, most AI applications are limited to Level 3 (L3) and below, relying on synchronous request/response patterns. This restricts their ability to handle complex, long-running, or autonomous workflows.

**Agentex** is designed to be future-proof, enabling you to build, deploy, and scale agents at any level (L1â€“L5). As your needs grow, you can seamlessly progress from basic to advanced agentic AIâ€”without changing your core architecture.

!!! note "Agentex is for all levels of AI agents"
    While Agentex is built to support advanced L4+ agents, it natively supports L1â€“L3 agents and simple request/response agents as well. You can start with basic conversational or task-based AI and seamlessly progress to fully autonomous, distributed, and asynchronous agentsâ€”all on the same platform. Agentex is future-proofed for a world where AI will be distributed across all levels.

## ðŸš€ Get Started

**Ready to build your first agent?**

**[â†’ Quick Start Guide on GitHub](https://github.com/scaleapi/scale-agentex#quick-start)** (5 minutes)

The README will guide you through:

- Installing prerequisites (Docker, Python 3.12+)
- Setting up your local development environment
- Creating and running your first agent with `agentex init`
- Accessing the web UI to interact with your agent

**Then return here to dive deeper:**

## Learning Path ðŸŽ“

### 1. Choose Your Approach

Read [Developing Agentex Agents](developing_agentex_agents.md) to understand the different approaches (Sync, Agentic, Temporal) and decide which fits your use case.

### 2. Learn by Example

**[Browse Tutorials on GitHub](https://github.com/scaleapi/scale-agentex-python/tree/main/examples/tutorials)** - Complete, runnable examples:

- **Sync ACP** - Simple request/response agents
- **Agentic ACP** - Stateful workflows and complex agents
- **Temporal** - Production-ready enterprise patterns

### 3. Understand the Architecture

Learn how Agentex works at a system level:

- [Architecture Overview](concepts/architecture.md) - System design and message flow
- [Agent-to-Client Protocol (ACP)](acp/overview.md) - Communication protocol details

!!! warning "Important"
    Pay special attention to the [Critical Concepts](concepts/callouts/overview.md) - they contain essential information about race conditions, message handling, and other implementation details.

### 4. Configure & Deploy

- [Manifest Setup](manifest_setup.md) - Agent configuration and deployment specifications
- [Deployment Guide](deployment/overview.md) - Deploy using CI/CD pipelines

### 5. API Reference

Keep the [API Reference](api/overview.md) handy for detailed Python SDK documentation when building your agents.
